about six months ago, my friend ask for my wifi password,
I gave it to him because it did not cost me.
Later he was watching nextflix and I asked him to sharee his 
password so I could watch some shows, his wife sitting in a car shouted
from distance saying "Nay. Because I am the one paying for it."

Later in the day, the man and his wife came asking what was wrong
with the wify that they couldn't watch netflix, I told them, "I changed the password, because I am the one paying for it"
