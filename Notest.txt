In the heart of Lagos, Nigeria, Akpan found himself at a marketing company, where every day felt like a street performance. "I expect you to be taking a leadership role by now. You are the most experienced here," his boss chided, glancing over his shoulders as they reviewed the proposal. The pressure was on, and Akpan could feel it building like a Lagos traffic jam.

Increased stress hung over him like the city smog, making him look disorganized and, at times, downright foolish. But he kept quiet, bottling up his emotions to avoid friction with his peers. He didn't want to fight and risk losing the connections he had. Little did he know that his silence was straining his relationships, especially with his manager.

Missed opportunities haunted him like Lagos traffic at rush hour. Promotion seemed like a distant dream as he constantly failed to voice his concerns or opinions. He flashed back to his days at the University of Ibadan, where he lost his love to a charismatic singer. Lower self-esteem had convinced him he wasn't enough, preventing any personal growth or self-awareness.

As days went by, physical health consequences emerged. Chronic stress fueled headaches, digestive problems, and weakened his immune system. His heart raced like the drumbeats at Fela's Shrine. And as if to numb it all, he turned to overeating, sleeping pill abuse, and reckless spending.

One evening, over a family dinner, the weight of loneliness crushed him. Everyone erupted in laughter, except Akpan. He mustered a half-hearted chuckle, more like a hiccup, hoping to join in the merriment. But the weight of his unspoken troubles dragged his smile down. As the laughter swelled, Akpan felt like a stranger at his own table.

"Stop it, everyone, stop!" he finally managed to interject, frustration brimming within him. In an impulsive motion, he brought his fork down, stabbing the table. Silence followed the clatter of metal against wood. Shocked faces turned to him, their eyes wide.The fork in his hand turned into a weapon, stabbing at the palm as a desperate plea for release. The hands of loneliness felt icy, and even a smile seemed like a derisive gesture. Yet, ignoring these issues didn't make them vanish.

With a newfound resolve, Akpan realized that he needed to change. He knew he couldn't bottle up his feelings forever. He decided to seek help from friends, family, or professionals at the psychiatrist hospital. He understood that healthy communication was the antidote to his struggles. In the bustling streets of Lagos, a new chapter began as he embarked on a journey of self-discovery and healing.
