Ade and Chike are two unlikely friends who found themselves caught in the whirlwind of corporate life. Ade, a seasoned accountant, was the embodiment of loyalty. He had been with the same firm for over a decade, never wavering in his commitment. Chika, on the other hand, was the epitome of wisdom. He had a knack for spotting opportunities, and his sharp wit often led him to strategic victories.

One sweltering Monday morning, as they sipped their bitter office coffee, Chika leaned in and whispered, "Ade, my friend, do you ever wonder why we toil so hard for this company? Loyalty is noble, but sometimes it's like we're burning the candle at both ends."

Ade raised an eyebrow, intrigued by Chika's enigmatic tone. "What are you getting at, Chika?"

Chika leaned back, a mischievous glint in his eye. "I've been studying our company's operations, Ade. There's a merger on the horizon, and I have it on good authority that it might not be in our best interest."

Ade's loyalty to the company ran deep, but he couldn't ignore the wisdom in Chika's words. "What should we do?"

Chika leaned closer, his voice barely a whisper. "We strategize, my friend. We gather our resources, build alliances, and ensure our interests are protected. Loyalty is admirable, but it's wisdom that will see us through this corporate storm."

And so, the two friends embarked on a suspenseful journey, navigating the treacherous waters of office politics, alliances, and betrayals. As the days turned into weeks, they uncovered secrets that sent shockwaves through the company. With loyalty as their shield and wisdom as their guiding star, they played their cards right.

In the end, as the merger unfolded, Ade and Chika emerged not as casualties but as victors. Their story became legendary in the company, a tale of how loyalty and wisdom, when combined, could conquer even the most challenging corporate challenges. And they continued to navigate the corporate jungle, balancing loyalty and wisdom, with a touch of satire, in every step they took.
Enter Franklin, a character who fancied himself as the company's private detective. With an uncanny ability to uncover workplace secrets and an unparalleled talent for inflating the Managing Director's (MD) ego, Franklin had climbed the corporate ladder faster than anyone expected. His colleagues often joked that he could sniff out a hidden agenda from a mile away.

Franklin's primary weapon was his relentless snitching. No office gossip or water cooler chat went unnoticed by his watchful eyes and ears. He would discreetly feed morsels of information to the MD, making it seem as if he were the guardian of the company's integrity.

Whenever the MD was around, Franklin was the embodiment of loyalty. He'd sing praises, concoct elaborate tales of his dedication to the company, and make himself scarce whenever the MD entered the office. He was a master of flattery and false loyalty, creating an illusion of indispensability.

However, when the merger was announced, Franklin's cunning strategies began to crumble. Despite his years of serving as the company's self-proclaimed watchdog, he couldn't point to any specific contributions or achievements. His supposed detective skills proved worthless in a corporate landscape that valued results over rumors.

As the merger progressed, Franklin found himself sidelined and, eventually, ousted from his position. His hollow loyalty and snitching had no place in the new company, which required employees to deliver tangible results rather than indulge in office politics.
