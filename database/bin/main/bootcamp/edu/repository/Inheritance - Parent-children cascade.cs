Abstract: Circle extend Shape: method calculate area
abstract class Shape {
    public abstract void calculateArea();
}

Clean Architecture: different layers UI, Use Cases, Data(maintainabilty, testability)
Clean Code: meaningful variables, easy to read code, single responsibility
Good Class: minimal dependencies, single responsibility
Writing New Code: following coding standards, use meaningful names, document 
             when necessary
Greenfield Development: New Project, build from scratch, gather requirements

Sprint: a 2-week development period
PI Planning: Performance index in a quarter
Daily Standup: meetings on progress for individual
